Ok so you know we are generating the transcript.... and it should be store in MongoDB as well....
So like you said after the transcript is generated it does 2 things, send a request to generated the audio, and save in database....

now somewhere during the process we need to chunk the transcript in less than 2000 characters so about 1800, and made it generate the audio pallel to each other.... there should be some webassembly envolved and other library to help organized the content receive, create the tanscript and organized the output and generate the audio fast and effectively.

let me know if you understand. what you understood.... and how do you plan to get this implemented....
like what are the steps and process you are planning to use, keep in mind we are trying to reinvent anything if their are helpful libraries or utils already doing some of the task we need, please let's use them....

So tell me your plan and tools or utils/library

first to generate a high quality content
2 fast yet high quality audio.


I understand the requirements. Let me break down the plan and suggest the tools/libraries for each part:

Content Generation & Processing:
Input handling: Text or document upload
Text processing and chunking:
Use natural library for intelligent text segmentation
Use compromise for NLP to ensure chunks break at natural points
Aim for ~1800 characters per chunk for optimal processing
Database Integration:
MongoDB for storing transcripts and audio metadata
Use Mongoose for schema management
Structure:
interface Transcript {
  id: string;
  chunks: Array<{
    text: string;
    audioUrl?: string;
    status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed'
  }>;
  metadata: {
    voice: Voice;
    audience: string;
    createdAt: Date;
  }
}
Parallel Audio Generation:
Web Workers for parallel processing
Libraries/Tools:
comlink for Web Worker communication
p-queue for managing concurrent API calls
web-streams-polyfill for handling streaming data
Audio Processing & Assembly:
Use Web Assembly (WASM) with:
ffmpeg.wasm for audio processing/concatenation
AudioWorklet API for real-time audio handling
StreamSaver.js for efficient file saving
Let me outline the implementation steps:

First, create a TranscriptProcessor service:
// Process text into optimal chunks
// Use natural + compromise for intelligent segmentation
// Return array of chunks ready for parallel processing
Then, create a ParallelAudioGenerator:
// Manage Web Workers pool
// Handle concurrent API calls to Play.HT
// Stream results back as they complete
Finally, create an AudioAssembler:
// Use WASM for efficient processing
// Combine audio chunks
// Handle final output
Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this plan?


Cline has a question:
Does this approach align with your requirements? Which part would you like me to implement first?
